I made this decision for a few different reasons:</p><br /><ul class="disc"><li>I wanted a bike with components that were better integrated (vs strapped to the frame)</li><li>I wanted a build that had refinements like internally-routed cables, that I couldn't easily do on my own build</li><li>I wanted a bike that was more stealthy and didn't really look like an eBike</li><li>I was becoming a stronger rider and wanted something that would encourage me to contribute more energy (getting more exercise) during a ride</li><li>Getting a factory warranty on the bike and components was icing on the cake</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Big&#x2c; Awesome Day</title><dc:creator>Matt Gilbert</dc:creator><category>Personal</category><dc:date>2016-09-09T12:44:33-04:00</dc:date><link>http://mattir.com/files/ffab5942741343f019c16efb28bd1875-4.html#unique-entry-id-4</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://mattir.com/files/ffab5942741343f019c16efb28bd1875-4.html#unique-entry-id-4</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[Before I get into why *today* was so great, I need to tell you about the day before it.
