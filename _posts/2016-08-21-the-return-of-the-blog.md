Well, I haven't done a very good job of keeping this blog up to date, but I've had a lot going on. I'll be back-filling stories onto the blog now, so keep your eyes out for many more updates.

By the way, I've built a new site in case you didn't notice. I'm still using Kirby, but I've completely re-done the front-end and back-end. I feel the new design is easier to navigate, and will make it easier for me to post content and for you to find it once its been posted. I hope you like it. Feel free to let me know what you think.
