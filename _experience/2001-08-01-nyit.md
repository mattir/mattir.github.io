I was hired into this job upon graduating from NYIT. I attended as a student at the Old Westbury campus of NYIT, but my job was at the Manhattan campus (located one block up from Columbus Circle). There was a PC lab used primarily for 3D graphics and video editing, and there were two Mac labs used for image editing, graphics design, digital media creation, and video editing. I managed the individual workstations, user-access, and ran a couple servers to keep everything in order.

* Responsible for running all aspects of the computer labs for the Fine Arts and Communication Arts departments
* Sourced, configured, and deployed all PC and Mac workstations for three computer-graphics labs
