{% include gallery caption="Some photos of our store, Crave Computers." %}

I opened this business with my brother. It was a Mac and PC retail and service shop. We were located in the historic downtown area of Riverhead, New York out on the east-end of Long Island. My brother ran the retail side of things while I ran the service and support end. We were the largest independent computer retailer in the area and we provided on-site as well as in-store service for the entire twin-forks region.

* Co-Owner and operator of a small business
* Managed the service and support side of the business
